Over all, myCity is an educational app that keeps you informed of:
- **Your legal rights & local laws**: (providing you with lawfirms in your town, and resources to learn about in case you feel you become unlawfully detained)
- **Available support resources:**   (govt agencies, non-profits, and local businesses that help with things such as
    - medical info, recovery resources, access to food, housing, etc)
- Later we plan to allow for **Instantly submitting and track benefits** applications via mobile app and mobile/user-friendly website. (It’s the get calfresh for all benefits.)
